//! Monocular depth: every frame leaves as a greyscale map of how far away it
//! is, near bright and far dark.
//!
//! The graph is Depth Anything V2 (small), run through `wasi:nn`. The module
//! never opens a file - the host binds the graph to a name with
//! `-nn depth=<path>` and this module asks for that name and nothing else.
//!
//! One frame in, one out, at the same geometry and in the same pixel format,
//! so the map can be fed straight back into a module that reads the frame
//! beside it. Between the two the frame is letterboxed into the square the
//! graph takes, normalized the way the model was trained, run, min-max
//! normalized over the frame's own range, and sampled back out to the frame's
//! own size.
